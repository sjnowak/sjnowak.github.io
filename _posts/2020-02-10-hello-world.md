Hello, if you are reading this, welcome! 

I have decided to start this blog to give myself a central place to write about the topics that I am exploring. Taking notes and sharing with others will reinforce the things I am learning and I think will help me improve my skills.

I am often lost in thought thinking about all the possibilities and looking at the overall picture, but through this blog and active note-taking, I will be better able to focus on a single topic.

One thing I have been doing for years is engaging with friends on Telegram in dialogue on topics that are interesting to me in the moment and explaining it to them. I often keep it brief as to not annoy them with information overload, but it feels like I have an untapped energy by not putting my ideas out to the world.

I will use this as an opportunity for fresh start. I can start with the basics and work my way up to more advanced subjects.
